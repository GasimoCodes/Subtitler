# Localization

[Localization Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.localization.html) is Unity's localization tool which helps you with authoring localized assets and switching them at runtime (such as text/audio/assets/scenes...).  

Subtitler offers optional Localization support, activated automatically when the Localization Package is imported.

## Added Components
- Timeline Localized Clips (if Timeline integration is present)
- Localized Sequences

> Localized components coexist with non-localized ones. Ensure you are using the localized versions if you wish to take advantage of the Localization Integration.
