# Localization

[Localization Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.localization.html) is Unity's localization tool which helps you with authoring localized assets and switching them at runtime (such as text/audio/assets/scenes...).  

Subtitler comes with an optional Localization support, which is enabled automatically when Localization Package is imported.

## Added Components
- Timeline Localized Clips (If Timeline integration is present)
- Localized Sequences
